    <h1>Skillet Cookie</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 taspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1 large cupcake packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup of sugar</li>
      <li>1 large eggs</li>
      <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>10 ounces chocolate chips, milk or semi-sweet, your choice!</li>
      <li>flaked salt, for topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.</li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, soda, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat an oven safe (preferably cast iron!) 12-inch skillet over low heat.
        Let the skillet heat up for 5 minutes. Add the butter and let it melt
        completely. Stir in the sugars with a wooden spoon. Turn off the heat
        under the skillet. You MUST turn off the heat! You can also remove the
        skillet from the burner if you wish. Whisk together the egg and egg
        yolks in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add it to the skillet sugar mixture and mix in right away with a spoon,
        quickly mixing so the eggs don’t cook from the heat. Stir in the vanilla
        extract.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the dry ingredients until just combined. This will take a minute
        or two and the mixture will be thick, but they will mix in! You can wipe
        the top of the skillet or the sides with a damp paper towel to remove
        excess flour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the chocolate chips. Bake the skillet cook for 20 to 25 minutes,
        or until it’s mostly set in the center.
      </li>
      <li>Top with flaked sea salt. Serve warm with vanilla ice cream.</li>
    </ol>
